            Why do you need a website?
            Your website will likely be the first impression a potential guest has of your company. Make it a good one.
            A website gives you control over the image of your business. It gives you the platform to tell your own
            story, in your own words (unlike third party sites). Customers will get a good idea of who you are, as well
            as get an idea of the overall atmosphere of the company. Potential customers want to know what to expect
            when they come to your business so include high-quality photos of your company workers and products. This is
            also a great opportunity to show how much your staff is appreciated by including pictures and bios of your
            employees.

            Having a website can also improve your search engine results, conveniences, and trust and loyalty of
            customers. Advertising through websites is cheaper than other forms, allowing you to make updates and
            announcements for any new things, and you can promote other services that your business offers.

            Over the course of his time as a student, Luke has participated in extensive research into the effects of
            media stimuli on mental health through the capstone program. Utilizing this knowledge, he hopes to develop
            user-friendly technologies that account for user mental health just as much as accessibility. Additionally,
            he has led service projects in Student Government, BETA club, and DECA raising thousands of dollars for
            covid relief, cancer patients, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the Juvenile Diabetes Research
            Foundation. Luke is excited to continue to expand his experience in this field and continue to help others
            in his local and outer community.
