        In the age of new technology, we are stuck with problems of the past. Smart infrastructure allows us to reduce traffic congestion, getting you to your destination faster.
        We in turn reduce your carbon emissions and your fuel consumption, while keeping you safer. This is truly only the beginning.

          </h1>
          <p>
            Based in Chapel Hill, we focus on the development of smart traffic lights.
            By allowing computer vision to assess each intersection, we're able to reduce traffic congestion through optimized signal timings.
            We then allow each intersection to share this data with one another, creating a grid of smart intersections with optimized routes for our drivers.

            Prior to Magnolia, he competed and won a programming challenge, in which he met with Congressman Joe Wilson,
            creating an app that helps students with their biology work. He also helped develop a machine learning model
            that used computer vision to identify diseases within rice crops to help farmers determine their crop
            safety. Milan has previously created a digital marketing agency, in which he helped multiple realtors earn
            thousands of dollars, through the utilization of Facebook Advertising. With his experience, he is ready and
